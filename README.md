# On-the-job Project 01: Code Refactor

## Description 

This project is about refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, for this time I am covering a small list of specific criteria.

I will rework the HTML trying to make it more efficient by adding semantic elements, following a logical structure in sequential order. Also I will add accessible alt attributes to image and icon elements. 

On the CSS, I will try to consolidate the selectors and properties, organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://mchinojo.github.io/day4/


## Installation

Clone the project and open it using your favourite browser (I recommend using Chrome).


## Usage 

Here is a screenshot of how the website should look, so you can compare it with my project. They are supossed to resemble at least in a 90%.
